## Hello World in Kubernetes

```shell
kubectl run hello-kube --image=fhsinchy/hello-kube --port=80

# pod/hello-kube created
```
* To make sure the pod has been created and is running,execute the following command:

```shell
> kubectl get pod
NAME                                 READY   STATUS             RESTARTS      AGE

```

* Note that the `STATUS=ImagePullBackOff` was looked into:

```shell

```

* The above was caused because the image path was wrong

```shell
> kubectl delete pod hello-kube

pod "hello-kube" deleted
> kubectl run hello-kube --image=fhsinchy/hello-kube --port=80
pod/hello-kube created

> kubectl get pod
NAME         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
hello-kube   1/1     Running   0          21s

```

* Pods by default are inaccessible from outside the cluster.
  * To make them accessible, you have to expose them using a service:
```shell
> kubectl expose pod hello-kube --type=LoadBalancer --port 80
service/hello-kube exposed

```

* Lets make sure the load balancer service has been created successfully:

```shell
> kubectl get service
NAME         TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
hello-kube   LoadBalancer   10.97.178.216   <pending>     80:30287/TCP   91s
kubernetes   ClusterIP      10.96.0.1       <none>        443/TCP        3d22h

```

* Make sure tyou see the `hello-kube` service in the list
  * You have a pod running that is exposed, you can go ahead an access that:

```shell
> minikube service hello-kube
|-----------|------------|-------------|---------------------------|
| NAMESPACE |    NAME    | TARGET PORT |            URL            |

## Kubernetes Architecture

* `node`: can either be a physical or a virtual machine with a given role.
* `cluster`: A collection of nodes using a shared network to communicate between each other

![kubernetes arch high level](imgs/kubernetes_arch_hl.png)

* In your local setup, minikube is a single node kubernetes cluster.
  * So instead of having multiple servers like in the diagram above `minikube` has only one that acts as both the control plane and the node

![minikube arch](imgs/minikube_arch.svg)

### Kubernetes Objects
#### Pods
* A `Pod` usually encapsulates one or more containers that are closely related sharing a life cycle and conumable resources.

![pod arch](imgs/pod.svg)

#### Services
* A `Service` groups together a number of pods that perform the same function and presents them as a single entity.

![load balancer service](imgs/load-balancer.svg)

## The Full Picture

![full picture](imgs/full_picture_arch.png)

* The first cmd that you ran was the `run` command:
```shell
kubectl run hello-kube --image=fhsinchy/hello-kube --port=80
```
* The `run` command is responsible for creating a new pod that runs the given image.
* Once you have issued this command, the following sets of events occur inside the kubernetes cluster:
  1. The `kube-api-server` component receives the request, validates it and process it
  2. The `kube-api-server` then communicates with the `kubelet` component on the node and provides the instructions necessary for creating the pod
  3. The `kubelet` component starts working on making the pod up and running and also keeps the state information updated in the `etcd` store

### Getting Rid of Kubernetes Resources
* The only way to get rid of a Kubernetes resource is to delete it

```shell
> kubectl delete pod hello-kube
pod "hello-kube" deleted
> kubectl get svc
NAME         TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
hello-kube   LoadBalancer   10.97.178.216   <pending>     80:30287/TCP   30m
kubernetes   ClusterIP      10.96.0.1       <none>        443/TCP        3d22h
> kubectl delete service hello-kube
service "hello-kube" deleted

```

* To delete all the objects of a resource, you can use the following syntax
```shell
kubectl delete <object type> --all

```
* kubectl delete pod --all and kubectl delete service --all respectively.

## Declarative Deployment Approach
* The `declarative approach`, lets kubernetes know the state you deisre your servers to be in and kubernetes figures out a way to implement that.

### Hello-Kube - Declarative

* Inside hello-kube/ directory for the application there is a Dockerfile for building the image.

```shell
> tree hello-kube
hello-kube
â”œâ”€â”€ Dockerfile
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â”œâ”€â”€ public
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ favicon.ico
â””â”€â”€ src
    â”œâ”€â”€ App.vue
    â”œâ”€â”€ assets
    â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ kubernetes-handbook-github.webp
    â”œâ”€â”€ components
    â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ HelloKube.vue
    â”œâ”€â”€ index.css
    â””â”€â”€ main.js

5 directories, 9 files

```
### Writing your first set of configurations
* In the declarative approach, instead of issuing commands in the terminal, you write down the necessary configuration in a YAML file and feed that to kubernetes
* k8s is short for k(ubernete = 8 character)s

#### Declarative approach creating pod - hello-kube

**hello-kube/k8s/hello-kube-pod.yaml**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: hello-kube-pod
  labels:
    component: web
spec:
  containers:
    - name: hello-kube
      image: fhsinchy/hello-kube
      ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```
**apiVersion**: which version of the Kubernetes API you are using to create this object.
    
    * This value may change depending on the kind of object you are creating
**kind**: What kind of object you want to create?

    * There are many objects in kubernetes, in the above its `Pod` object

**metadata**: data that hleps uniqueley identify the object.
  * Under this field you can have information like `name`, `labels`, `annotation`, etc
  * Fields(metadata):
    * `metadata.name`: string will show up on the terminal & will be used in kubectl commands.
    * `metadata.labels`: does not have to be `components: web` it can be any set of key-value.
    
**spec**: contains the state you desire for the object.
  * Fields(spec):
    * `spec.containers`: contains information about the containers that will run inside this `Pod`
    * `spec.containers.name`: value is what will the container runtime inside the node will assigning to the newly created container
    * `spec.containers.image`: is the container image to be used for creating this container
    * `spec.containers.ports`: holds configuration regarding various ports configuration
      * containerPort: 80 - indicates that you want to expose port 80 from the container.

* To feed these configuration files to kubernetes please use `apply`:
```shell
kubectl apply -f <configuration file>
```

* To feed a configuration file named `hello-kube-pod.yaml`, the command as follows:
```shell
> kubectl apply -f k8s/hello-kube-pod.yaml
pod/hello-kube-pod created
> kubectl get pod
NAME             READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
hello-kube-pod   1/1     Running   0          20s
```

* Once the `Pod` is up and running, its time for you to write the configuration file for the `LoadBalancer` service

**hello-kube/k8s/hello-kube-load-balancer-service.yaml**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: hello-kube-load-balancer-service
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 80
selector:
  component: web
```

* As you see with the pod configuration file: `apiVersion`, `kind`, and `metadata` have same purposes
* Whats different in the two kinds of configuration files is that in `kind: Service` does not have any `labels`, other objects dont select a service.
* Inside the `spec`: you can see a new set of values:
* unlike a `kind: Pod`, a service has four types of these:
  1. CLusterIP
  2. NodePort
  3. LoadBalancer
  4. ExternalName

* In this example, we are using `spec.type: LoadBalancer`
  * Its a std way for exposing a service outside the cluster
  * This service will give you an IP address that you can use to connected to the applications running inside your cluster

* The `LoadBalncer` type requires two port values to work properly:
  1. `spec.ports.port`: value is for accessing the pod itself and its value can be anything you want.
  2. `spec.ports.targetPort`: the port of the running container

* The `selector` field is used to identify the objects that will be connected to this service.
  * matching their key-value map to labels of pods, etc, 
  * Example: we already have a pod with one key-value pair `component: web`

* To feed this file to kubernetes you will again use the `apply` command:

```shell
$ kubectl apply -f hello-kube/k8s/hello-kube-load-balancer-service.yaml
service/hello-kube-load-balancer-service created
```
* To make sure the load balancer has been created successfully execute the following command:
```shell
> kubectl get service
NAME                               TYPE           CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
hello-kube-load-balancer-service   LoadBalancer   10.105.152.205   <pending>     80:30535/TCP   74s
kubernetes                         ClusterIP      10.96.0.1        <none>        443/TCP        4d3h

```
**Note: metadata.name=NAME**
* Now to open the application use the following command:
```shell
> minikube service hello-kube-load-balancer-service
|-----------|----------------------------------|-------------|---------------------------|
| NAMESPACE |               NAME               | TARGET PORT |            URL            |
|-----------|----------------------------------|-------------|---------------------------|
| default   | hello-kube-load-balancer-service |          80 | http://192.168.49.2:30535 |
|-----------|----------------------------------|-------------|---------------------------|
ðŸŽ‰  Opening service default/hello-kube-load-balancer-service in default browser...

### The Kubernetes Dashboard
* With the Kubernetes dashboard is a graphical UI that you can use to mange your workloads, services, and more

```shell
> minikube dashboard
ðŸ”Œ  Enabling dashboard ...
    â–ª Using image docker.io/kubernetesui/dashboard:v2.7.0
    â–ª Using image docker.io/kubernetesui/metrics-scraper:v1.0.8
ðŸ’¡  Some dashboard features require the metrics-server addon. To enable all features please run:

        minikube addons enable metrics-server

ðŸ¤”  Verifying dashboard health ...
